        <p>
            It is one of the best getaway places. It is the largest of French Polynesia's islands. You can swim with <b>humpback whales</b> from <b>August to October</b> as female whales come to give birth by the island. There are also lots of marine creatures such as sharks, rays and dolphins in which you should schedule a <b>watch tour</b> if not a <b>swimming/snorkeling</b> chance!
